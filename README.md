Given a background photo, you can draw lines on top of it whose relative
length is shown. Double-clicking on a line allows you to set a
'reference size', all the other numbers are adjusted accordingly.

Use this for instance by taking a picture of something with a ruler in the
same focus; use the ruler to set a reference size and now you have correct
measurements for the other parts in the picture.
